This code was used for the analysis of ITS2 sequencing samples from different clinical studies carried out in institute of medical microbiology UMC Freiburg. 

The sample analysis workflow uses illumina short read fastq files as an input.
Mycobiome sequencing experiment are usually carried out using the following primers:-
ITS region 2 (ITS2) gene	
Ihrmark-gITS7-F	    TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGTGARTCATCGARTCTTTG
Tedersoo-ITS4ngs-R	GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGTTCCTSCGCTTATTGATATGC


Other primers used for specific sample cohorts:-
Bellemain-ITS1-F	 TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA
Bellemain-ITS2	   GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC

The DNA extraction and library preparation is usually done as described here: https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/10/11/3226
